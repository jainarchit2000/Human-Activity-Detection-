## Human Activity Prediction
This dataset consists of six human activities namely _Standing_, _Laying_, _Sitting_, _Walking_, _Walking_Upstairs_ and  _Walking_Downstairs_. The aim of this project is to formulate a machine learning model which predicts the activity performed by a human being with the help of some inputs.

**Size of Train dataset:**
    The dataset contains **2887** rows and **563** columns.
 
**Size of Test dataset:**
   The dataset contains **722** rows and **562** columns.

**Target Variable:**
   _activity_ is the target variable.

Since the number of columns in the dataset is large, therefore first applied a dimensionality reduction technique to remove the columns which are not adding much information to our model.
